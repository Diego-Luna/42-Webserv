questions for the meeting:

Call structure
	who calls Requests, it would be useful to have a 
	reference to the server in the request Class, how best to do it?


Steps to implement:

	Environment creation -> mostly done.

	testing execution: there seems to be things in there
	but it's not been tested to check how well it is doing

	handling redirection -> somewhat done, but I do think
	we might have better ways to deal with it.

	Grabbing output from CGI execution and reading into
	a response class / dealing with the response.

	Response class in cases without CGI, for simple GET / DELETE

	Final Checks

send which vars are eneded from server
