for the meeting:


			centralize poll() calls into a single one
				maybe have it be carried through to the rest of 
				the code? as in every class having a reference for
				the poll struct?
				how would that work with multiple server objects
				
				create a default error page
						do we have it?
						how to incorporate it into the routes?
				
				right now the root address is being hardcoded
				how to retrieve it from server?
